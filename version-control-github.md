      ## Commit to save state

      - Commit when you’ve done something significant
        *Added the navigation, styled the footer, fixed a bug*
      - Every commit needs a message describing what changed
      - **Commit often!**
      - It’s a habit you’ll have to form

      ## Good commit messages
