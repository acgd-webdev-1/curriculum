  - title: "Create a GitHub account"
    before: |
      Git is a version control system and GitHub allows us to host all our code & websites online. (More on this next week.)

      ![](github.jpg)

      1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account.
        *Choose whatever username and email address you’d like.*
      2. Choose the *free* plan when you get to that screen.
    notes:
      - label: "Remember"
        text: "Though it shouldn’t need to be said: remember your password!"

  - title: "Create your Progressinator account"
    before: |
      For the Web Dev courses you’ll be watching your progress & getting your grades on a application named Progressinator—instead of in Algonquin’s BrightSpace.

      Progressinator connects to Markbot and the Learn the Web website to track your progress and for submitting assignments.

      ![](progress-github.jpg)

      *Go to [Progressinator](https://progress.learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/) and sign in using your GitHub account.*

      You don’t need a unique username & password for signing into Progressinator—it uses your GitHub account as the authentication mechanism.

  - title: "Set your current course & section"
    before: |
      Next up you can set your current course & section. This shows correct due dates in the grades list & allows the teacher to find you within the class list.

      **Click your username in the top right corner to visit your profile page.**

      ![](progress-profile.jpg)

      *Select your section from the list of available Web Dev 1 sections.*

      **And save.**

  - title: "Keep the profile tab open"
    before: |
      **Don’t close this profile tab.** Keep it open, we’re going to need it again in a few minutes.
