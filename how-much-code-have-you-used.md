      ## What & why

      You use significantly more code that you likely realize. We, of course, will focus on interface-based code—but you’d be surprised at the code you interact with.

      When we realize how much code we use, we realize that somebody has to code & design that.

      **Learning what code runs the world helps us understand the need for learning Web Development.**

      ## List all the things you’ve interacted with this morning:

      - Your mobile?
      - Messaging apps? Social media apps?
      - Did you swipe your card for the bus?
      - Did you pay for parking?
      - Watch streaming videos?
      - Played a game?
      - Buy a snack or a drink?

      ## Who made that thing?

      - Who wrote that code?
      - Who designed & coded that interface?
      - Who designed & coded that interaction?

      *We concentrate on coding web-based things—which show up often than you realize.*
